# GEP-1713: Standard Mechanism to Merge Multiple Gateways

* Issue: [#1713/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1713)
* Status: Provisional

(See status definitions [here](overview.md#status).)

## TLDR

The Gateway Resource is a contention point since it is the only place to attach listeners with certificates. We propose a mechanism to allow distinct Gateway resources to be logically merged.

## Goals

- Define a mechanic to merge multiple Gateways (logically)
- Define a set of acceptable properties that can be merged and their semantics

## Non-Goals

- Apply a Gateway resource onto N distinct gateways (one to many)

## Introduction

Knative generates on demand per-service certificates using HTTP-01 challenges. There can be O(1000) Knative Services in the cluster which means we have O(1000) distinct certificates. Thus updating a single Gateway resource with this many certificates is a contention point and inhibits horizontal scaling of our controllers.

The spec currently has language to indicate implemenations `MAY` merge Gateways resources but the mechanic isn't defined. 
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/541e9fc2b3c2f62915cb58dc0ee5e43e4096b3e2/apis/v1beta1/gateway_types.go#L76-L78

## Future Requirement Level

We want to keep this API very simple so that the merging requirement level could increase from `MAY` to `MUST`

## API

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: parent-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: example
  listeners:
  - name: default
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: child-gateway
  labels:
    gateway.networking.k8s.io/parent-gateway: parent-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: example
  parentGateway: parent-gateway
  listeners:
  - name: metrics
    port: 8080
    protocol: HTTP
```

With this configuration, an implementation:
* This introduces a new concept in Gateway merging of a "primary" Gateway. 
* `MUST` treat the `parentGateway` as having the concatenated list of all listeners from merged Gateways.
  This means, for example, that a Service with port 80 and 443 may be created in this example.
* This makes it explicit which is the primary gateway and which are attached to it.
* Secondary Gateways cannot configure `addresses` and must have the same `gatewayClassName` as the primary Gateway they are attached to. 
* Gateways can only reference a primary Gateway. That is, we cannot have a chain of references.
* A common webhook will default the `gateway.networking.k8s.io/parent-gateway` label to make it easy for implementations to label selector lookups
* Each `Gateway` will only list listeners in their status if there is a corresponding entry in their spec.

## Alternatives

#### New Resource
A `GatewayListener` resource could be a simpler solution as we would not have to set required fields (ie. gatewayClassName)

```
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: GatewayListener
metadata:
  name: listener
  labels:
    gateway.networking.k8s.io/parent-gateway: parent-gateway
spec:
  gateway: parent-gateway
  listeners:
  - name: metrics
    port: 8080
    protocol: HTTP
status: ...
```

#### Use of the `gateway.networking.k8s.io/parent-gateway` label

We could drop the `parentGateway` in the `spec` and just leverage the use of a label to signal a parent-child relationship.
